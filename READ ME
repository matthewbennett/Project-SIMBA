OVERVIEW Entry Date 2-24-2014 
-----------------------------
The overall intent of this project is to have a library of JAVA methods that can be used to assemble a automated trading bot. SIMBA currently only supports BTC-e trading exchange, However more exchanges might be added in the future but consistency will continue to be the main focus.

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
There are currently two main parts of SIMBA Library, a set of classes and methods for a Arbitrage between currency pairs. 
  
  *The Arbitrage 
    the program was first built in one class with the ability to check for exploits surrounding a single crypto currency tested and tweaked until successful profitable trading sequences where made semi consistently. Then the methods where separated into classes where multiple crypto currencies pairs could be checked for exploits at once, Due to multi threading and static variables the multi threaded version of the arbitrage functionality is much less consistent. 

  *The AI 
    the program is built in a single class file with the intent to get a semi consistent output before separating methods into class files. After multiple builds and tweaking a consistent profitable output as not be tuned yet, however the data pulling methods work consistently. 

  *The API 
    SIMBA is built on top of the API built by Brain Waters, located here 
    https://github.com/abwaters/btce-api

EXAMPLES OF EXPLOITS 
--------------------
These are the examples of exploits i have found this far however I am sure more exist!
